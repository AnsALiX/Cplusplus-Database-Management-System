🗂️ Database Management System (C++ Project)

Author: Muhammad Ans Ali
Language: C++
Description:
This is a simple Database Management System (DBMS) built using C++ to demonstrate the concepts of file handling, structures, and data management. The project allows users to perform basic database operations like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing records — simulating how data is managed in real-world systems.

⚙️ Features

Add, search, update, and delete records

Data stored permanently using file handling

Menu-driven interface with simple user interaction

Uses C++ structures and loops for efficient data processing

🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of:

File handling in C++

Data storage and retrieval logic

Menu-driven program design

Problem-solving and modular programming

🚀 Future Improvements

Add password protection for admin access

Support multiple tables and record types

Improve user interface and error handling

💡 Note

This is an educational project developed during my Programming Fundamentals learning phase. It demonstrates the basics of how databases work internally before using professional tools like SQL or Firebase.
